# Detection of Particle Concentration Using Light Scattering Mechanism

There are various methods of detection of particle. For simplicity and cost measurement issue , involvement of optoelectronics is ensured. Laser based detector is thus developed in this project. Using the properties of
scattering due to particle photon interaction, reflected light intensity has been measured via external webcam.
